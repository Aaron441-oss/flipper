# Adapters

I plan on supporting the adapters in the flipper repo. Other adapters are welcome, so please let me know if you create one.

## Versioning

There are currently two possible versions of adapters. Flipper handles both gracefully, but it is worth mentioning that V1 is deprecated and will be removed at some point in the future. Additionally, some new functionality will only work with V2 adapters.

* [V1 adapters](./Adapters-V1.md)
* [V2 adapters](./Adapters-V2.md)
